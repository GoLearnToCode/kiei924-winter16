# Due Next Thursday by 11:59PM

Continue working on your username.github.io project. Create a new index.html page and add visual styles that apply good design principles and that are responsive across a variety of devices and platforms. (You should rename your original index.html, if you want to keep it.)

You should:

- Link to the Bootstrap CSS framework in your HEAD tag
- Utilize the Bootstrap grid system to create a logical separation in your design elements (e.g. header, content, sidebar, footer) on medium-sized (992px wide and up) devices and up
- Ensure that on small sized devices (768px and up), you can still see content and a sidebar, and that content is not simply stacked
- Use at least one of Bootstrap's built-in CSS classes to style HTML elements. Examples:
  - Make a link look like a button
  - Style a table
  - Make an image square, rounded, or circle
- Use at least one other Bootstrap design component
  - Nav
  - Navbar
  - Label
  - Alert
  - Etc.

Commit and sync your changes to your Github account no later than 11:59pm on Thursday.
