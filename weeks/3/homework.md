# Due Next Sunday by 11:59PM

Create a new repository (sub-folder of your main code folder), and name it *weather*. Give this folder "magic powers" by adding this to your Github app and create the corresponding repository called *weather* in your Github account. When this project is complete, I should be able to view your project online at `https://github.com/<your username>/weather`.

In your weather app, you should create two files:

- index.html
- weather.js

Using `https://github.com/kiei924-winter16/weather` to help guide you along (do not attempt to clone or fork this repository - just use it to help you get started) you should:

- Link the Bootstrap CSS and JS files to index.html
- Link weather.js to your index.html page, and write code in weather.js so that clicking a button on the page retrieves weather data from Forecast.io and displays it on screen. You should include (at least):
  - Current weather conditions
  - 3-day daily forecast

Commit and sync your code to your Github account no later than 11:59PM on Sunday for full credit.
