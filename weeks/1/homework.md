**1. Setup Your Development Environment**

In case you didn't before the first class, [follow the instructions to install all necessary development tools](/kiei924-fall15/workbook/setup).

# Due Next Sunday by 11:59PM

Practice what we did in class.  You should be able to:

1. Create a new text file named "index.html"
2. Make this page your own. It could your personal profile page, blog, list of recipes, or any other idea you might have. Use the guidelines as listed below.
3. View the page in your browser.
4. The browser tab should display a meaningful title describing what the page is about (e.g. "About Me", "Brian's Recipes", etc.)
5. Link to a separate stylesheet file. Style the page however you want, keeping in mind the guidelines below.
6. Sync your code into your GitHub.com account. The repository should be named *(your Github username)*.github.io. For example, my Github username is *eng*, so my repository name for this assignment should be *eng.github.io*. This will automatically make your page available on the public Internet at that address (e.g. http://eng.github.io/).

## Guidelines

You should use these elements at least once, and use proper indentation and spacing:

* h1
* p
* ul
* li
* a
* h2
* body
* html
* title
* head

You should apply CSS styles three different ways:

* By element
* By ID
* By class
