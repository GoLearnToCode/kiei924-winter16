# First Day Setup: Your Development Environment

## 1. Code Editor

The code editor is a piece of software that is used to create and edit text files. It's like Microsoft Word, but for code files instead of word processing documents. In this class, we'll use Sublime Text.

### Download and Install Sublime Text

[Click here to get Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). I recommend the Sublime 3 Beta. Download the appropriate installer for your computer and run it.

It's free to try out, but after 30 days you might get nagged to pay for it (which you should do).

Also don't miss the "unofficial" but excellent [documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/index.html).

## 2. Git and Github

Git is a technology that professional developers use to store their code and share it with others. Github is a company that provides a popular hosted Git service.

### Create a Github account

Sign up for a free Github account at [the Github website](https://github.com/). You'll be using your Github account for lots of things in class – including turning in your homework and tracking your attendance in class – so keep your account information at the ready!

### Download and Install the Github App

[For Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)

Once installed, run the Github app. You'll be asked to enter the Github username and password you just created, along with your name and email address. Once you've done this, you should be at an empty "Dashboard view", and you're all set.

## 3. Create a place to store your code and download the project for the first class

We'll need a place to store all the code we'll be writing this quarter.

On Mac, create a folder called *code* in your *home directory*. (What's the home directory? In the *Finder*, it's accessible via the sidebar – it's the one with the "house" icon and is marked with the username you've used to log-in to your computer.)

On Windows, create a folder called *code* in the root of your C:\ drive.

Finally, download the following and unzip it into your code folder. When you're done, you should have a folder called "profile" in your *code* directory.
